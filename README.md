## Introduction
The Deltaback e-commerce website was constructed as part of coursework in university.
The website was created to be user-friendly, mobile-friendly, and interactive, so that anyone with basic computer skills could use it with any modern web browser. The website should offer a simple experience to both regular and one-time visitors.

After successfully registering, the user will be redirected to the Sign In page to log into the system. The screenshot shows the Sign In page of our website.
If the password entered does not match the password for the corresponding username, an error message is displayed.
When all of the data entered is correct and the user clicks the submit button, a session is created and he is redirected to our website's home page.

3. Category Page

The game cards were created with HTML and CSS, and the layout system was built with CSS Grid Layout. This layout system is a two-dimensional system, which means it can handle both columns and rows, as opposed to flexbox, which is primarily a one-dimensional system. Their respective sql queries were saved in a.php file, and all product information was loaded from the database.
